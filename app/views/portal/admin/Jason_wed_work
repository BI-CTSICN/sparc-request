Strategy for hiding/showing ssr's

- Make helper method that takes in @study_tracker, ssr, @user
- If we're not in study tracker, just return true(show)
- If we are, need to check if any of the line items under the ssr are under the same core as the user
- If there are any, return true.  
- Place this check in ssr list, within the ssr loop.
