Assumptions/Directions:
  * You have obis-bridge alias for ssh in .ssh/config (this is needed because we have to bundle install the DeployGemfile to create a lock file)

  * bundle install --gemfile DeployGemfile and then commit the DeployGemfile.lock

  * mysql is installed and empty database has been created

  * rvm is installed system wide

  * add rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag=1 to /etc/rvmrc

  * set default ruby to one used by app ## not totally sure if this is necessary

  * httpd is installed

  * sudo gem install passenger

  * rvmsudo passenger-install-apache2-module

  * copy lines passenger provides into /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    # load phusion passenger
    LoadModule passenger_module /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p286/gems/passenger-3.0.17/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
    PassengerRoot /usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p286/gems/passenger-3.0.17

  * create a conf file for the app /etc/httpd/conf.d/sparc-rails.conf and change the RackEnv
    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName obis-sparc-dev.mdc.musc.edu
      DocumentRoot /var/www/rails/sparc-rails/current/public
      <Directory /var/www/rails/sparc-rails/current/public>
        AllowOverride all
        Options -MultiViews
        RackEnv testing
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

  * capistrano user exists and has access to rvm group

  * your public key has been added to the capistrano users .ssh/authorized_keys file

  * capistrano user has sudo rights, needed to update/install rvm

  * after cap deploy:setup you must manually create shared/config/database.yml and shared/config/setup_load_paths.rb
    example database.yml

    testing:
      adapter: mysql2
      database: sparc_rails_testing
      username: root
      password: password

    example setup_load_paths.rb

    if ENV['MY_RUBY_HOME'] && ENV['MY_RUBY_HOME'].include?('rvm')
      begin
        gems_path = ENV['MY_RUBY_HOME'].split(/@/)[0].sub(/rubies/,'gems')
        ENV['GEM_PATH'] = "#{gems_path}:#{gems_path}@global"
        require 'rvm'
        RVM.use_from_path! File.dirname(File.dirname(__FILE__))
      rescue LoadError
        raise "RVM gem is currently unavailable."
      end
    end

    # If you're not using Bundler at all, remove lines bellow
    ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'] = File.expand_path('../DeployGemfile', File.dirname(__FILE__))
    require 'bundler/setup'

  * capistrano user has rights to clone the obis-bridge and sparc-rails repos from github, make sure the capistrano users key is added as key for a user that rights to the repos

  * to update obis-bridge
    - bump the version number in lib/obis-bridge/version.rb (not really necessary)
    - rm DeployGemfile.lock
    - bundle install --gemfile DeployGemfile
    - git add DeployGemfile*
    - commit and push
    - cap deploy
