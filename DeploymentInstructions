Assumptions/Directions:
  * You have obis-bridge alias for ssh in .ssh/config (this is needed because we have to bundle install the DeployGemfile to create a lock file)
  * bundle install --gemfile DeployGemfile and then commit the DeployGemfile.lock
  * mysql is installed and empty database has been created
  * rvm is installed system wide
  * httpd is installed
  * sudo gem install passenger
  * rvmsudo passenger-install-apache2-module
  * capistrano user exists and has access to rvm group
  * your public key has been added to the capistrano users .ssh/authorized_keys file
  * capistrano user has sudo rights, needed to update/install rvm
  * after cap deploy:setup you must manually create shared/config/database.yml
  * capistrano user has rights to clone the obis-bridge and sparc-rails repos from github (require 2 keys and .ssh/config to be setup)
    - ssh-keygen -t rsa twice and copy these keys to github as deploy keys
    - example .ssh/config
      Host obis-bridge
      HostName github.com
      User git
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/obis_bridge
